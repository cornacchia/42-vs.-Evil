# 42 vs. Evil

This repository holds the complete code for a game made by Jacopo F. (art & graphics) and me (programming & music) using the wonderful [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/).

[It's freely playable online on itch.io](https://cornacchia.itch.io/42-vs-evil)

In the spirit of open source, this repository contains all the code, assets and music we produced and can be directly imported and tinkered with in the Godot engine editor.
